This may be relevant given the majority of EU imports are likely to be for hedging which may be impacted to a greater degree than mature specimens. Social impacts are also uncertain; but poor aesthetic quality of beech trees may be an issue should the pathogen establish. ,,In terms of pathway there is relative certainty but the amount of EU imports is relatively unknown.
